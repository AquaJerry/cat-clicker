__Change Logs v0.0.1__

There should be two menus on a blank.

- List of cat names
- Admin Area

Clicking any of names will show it's cover, leaving menu close.

Admin Area is somewhere you can rename a cat, change its cover photo, or even change the number of how many people love it.

Here's the interaciton spec.

Before | Click | After
-|-|-
blank | menu | menu
menu | blank | blank
menu | menu | blank
menu 1 | menu 2 | blank

```html
<!-- Before: blank -->
<blank>
    <menu click="open"></menu>
    <menu click="open"></menu>
</blank>

<!-- Before: menu -->
<blank click="close">
     <menu open></menu>
     <menu></menu>
</blank>
```

But there seems someting wrong in the actual code.
